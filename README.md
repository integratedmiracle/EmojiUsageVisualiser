# EmojiUsageVisualiser
This is an UNFINISHED attempt to visualise the real-time emoji usage data on Twitter, using [emojitracker streaming API](https://github.com/emojitracker/emojitrack-streamer-spec).
I'm currently working on the visualising part with blender - however, blender has a problem with heavier scripts, and it crashes whenever there's real-time in the script. I'm trying to solve it with ZeroMQ, inspired by [Blender ZMQ Add-on](https://github.com/NumesSanguis/Blender-ZMQ-add-on). <br> ...but before that I'm just gonna save them in json.
